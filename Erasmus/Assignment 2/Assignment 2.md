# [Assignment 2] Basic methods

## ðŸ“‘ Description 

Develop an application with a graphical user interface implementing the Kepner-Tregoe method. Kepner-Tregoe is a simple decision method that allows the scoring of different alternatives based on multiple parameters. Each parameter is weighted (from 0 to 10) based on the user-defined importance of a specific parameter. Each parameter of each alternative is then quantitively scored by the user. The final score of each alternative is finally calculated using the weighted sum, where each weight of each parameter is multiplied with the given scores; those scores are at the end summed up and represent a final score of each alternative.
